# SVHN Digit Recognition Using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
This project is focused on recognizing digits from the Street View House Numbers (SVHN) dataset using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). The model is implemented using TensorFlow and Keras libraries and demonstrates various CNN architectures with visualization of training progress and evaluation of model performance.

## Project Overview
The SVHN dataset is obtained from house numbers in Google Street View images. The goal is to train a deep learning model to accurately classify digits from 0 to 9.
Key Features
## Dataset:
SVHN dataset, single grayscale digits.
## Models:
Several CNN architectures with varying configurations.
## Training:
Data preprocessing, data augmentation, and model training.
## Evaluation:
Model accuracy, loss analysis, and confusion matrix visualization.
## Libraries:
TensorFlow, Keras, Seaborn, NumPy, Matplotlib, OpenCV, and Scikit-learn.
## Dataset
The SVHN dataset used here is in .h5 format, containing pre-split training, validation, and test sets.


## Architecture and Approach
Three different CNN models are implemented, each using different configurations, such as:

## Baseline CNN model: 
A simple CNN with 32 filters in convolutional layers and max pooling.
## Batch Normalization CNN:
A CNN architecture enhanced with batch normalization layers.
## Extended CNN:
A deeper CNN with additional convolutional layers and dropout for regularization.
Model Architecture
## The CNN models use the following components:

## Conv2D layers: 
To extract features from the input images.
## MaxPooling2D layers: 
To downsample the feature maps.
## BatchNormalization layers: 
To stabilize and accelerate the training.
## Dropout layers: 
To prevent overfitting by randomly dropping units.
## Dense layers: 
To map the extracted features to the final classification output.
Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/svhn-digit-recognition.git
cd svhn-digit-recognition
Install the necessary libraries:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Download the dataset (make sure to adjust the file path in the code):

## You can download the SVHN dataset from SVHN Dataset Website.
## Running the Model
## Preprocessing:

The images are normalized by scaling the pixel values between 0 and 1.
The labels are converted to one-hot encoding for categorical classification.
## Training:

Train the model using the training set.
Validate the model using the validation set.
Track the performance using accuracy and loss over epochs.
Example:

## python
Copy code
primary_model_history = primary_model.fit(x=x_train, y=y_train,
                                          validation_data=(x_val, y_val),
                                          batch_size=32,
                                          epochs=20)
## Evaluation:

Test the model on unseen test data and generate metrics like accuracy and confusion matrix.
Visualize the results using plots of the training accuracy, loss, and confusion matrix.
Example:

## python
## Copy code
primary_model_scores = primary_model.evaluate(x_test, y_test)
print("Test Accuracy: %.2f%%" % (primary_model_scores[1]*100))
Results and Visualizations
Training/Validation Accuracy & Loss: Visualized using Matplotlib for each model.
Confusion Matrix: Displays the classification performance of each digit class.
Example plot of training and validation accuracy:

## python
## Copy code
plt.plot(history['accuracy'], label='train_accuracy')
plt.plot(history['val_accuracy'], label='val_accuracy')
plt.legend()
## Confusion Matrix

## Future Improvements
Implement more advanced architectures like ResNet or EfficientNet.
Hyperparameter tuning to further improve performance.
Explore data augmentation techniques to increase training data variability.
## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the effectiveness of CNNs in recognizing digits from the SVHN dataset. The models trained are evaluated on multiple metrics, and visualizations are provided to analyze their performance.
